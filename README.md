### ‚úÖ Automated Tests

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The solutions are developed following Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices.

Example of test for `two_sum.py` with `pytest`.

```python
from solutions.arrays.two_sum import twoSum


def test_two_sum():
    assert twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9) == [0, 1]
    assert twoSum([3, 2, 4], 6) == [1, 2]
    assert twoSum([3, 3], 6) == [0, 1]
```

To run tests:

```bash
pytest tests/
```
